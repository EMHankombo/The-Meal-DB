# The-Meal-DB
Application which pulls data from the Meal DB api (https://themealdb.com/api.php). Used MVVM pattern with architecture components
ViewModel and LiveData. Utilised RxJava 2 for asynchronous operations with Retrofit and OkHttp for networking. Mockito for unit tests. For dependency injection I used Dagger 2.
